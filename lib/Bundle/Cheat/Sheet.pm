=head1 NAME

Bundle::Cheat::Sheet - Copy-and-paste usage lines for lazy coders

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Bundle::Cheat::Sheet version 0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Cheat::Sheet'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<If a thing is worth having, it's worth cheating for.> 
--W. C. Fields

This is a collection of "cheat sheets": highly compressed, abbreviated 
documentation for various modules. Each module within the bundle covers a 
top-level namespace or a set of otherwise closely-related modules. 

For each module, a paragraph is given, generally: 

    Some::Module            # Short description
        qw( various exportable symbols if any );
        routine( $placeholder, @arguments );
        $context    = function( @arguments);
        $object->method();

You should be able to copy and paste this into your own code, 
delete what you don't need, and be on your way.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No cheat sheet will teach you anything. It's only a reminder. You B<must> 
consult each module's own full documentation I<at least> before using it. 
I hope.
