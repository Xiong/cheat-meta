Cheat-Meta version 0.0.5

DEVELOPER README

If a thing is worth having, it's worth cheating for. 
    --W. C. Fields

This is a collection of "cheat sheets": highly compressed, abbreviated 
documentation for various modules. Each module within the bundle covers a 
top-level namespace or a set of otherwise closely-related modules. 

For each module, a paragraph is given, generally: 

    Some::Module            # Short description
        qw( various exportable symbols if any );
        routine( $placeholder, @arguments );
        $context    = function( @arguments);
        $object->method();

You should be able to copy and paste this into your own code, 
delete what you don't need, and be on your way. 


FOR DEVELOPERS

I created the Cheat:: top-level namespace and scheme after much hesitation 
and some encouragement. Please read Cheat::Meta::Spec for more info.
